                    <h3>Reflective Insights on Problem Solving</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>How do you determine the most efficient approach when solving a complex problem?</strong>  
                            The approach depends on analyzing time complexity, space complexity, and constraints of the problem. I compare various algorithms and pick the most optimized one based on the given requirements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reflect on a situation where you need to balance multiple conflicting constraints in a design.</strong>  
                            When designing a system with limited resources, I prioritized critical features first while ensuring non-essential components remained functional, adopting a trade-off strategy to maximize the system’s efficiency.</li>
                        <li><strong>What criteria do you use to evaluate the effectiveness of a solution?</strong>  
                            I evaluate a solution by considering correctness, efficiency, maintainability, and simplicity. For instance, the correctness of sorting algorithms can be validated by their ability to handle edge cases and large datasets.</li>
                        <li><strong>How can you adapt an existing solution to address a new or unforeseen challenge?</strong>  
                            Solutions can be adapted by identifying bottlenecks or areas where a new constraint requires optimization, such as adapting a batch-processing algorithm to real-time streaming data.</li>
                        <li><strong>What strategies do you use to identify patterns or structures in complex datasets or problems?</strong>  
                            I use clustering algorithms like K-means to identify patterns, especially in large datasets, which can help uncover hidden relationships and structures.</li>
                        <li><strong>How do you decide when to prioritize simplicity over optimization in a solution?</strong>  
                            Simplicity is prioritized when the problem is small-scale, or when optimizing complexity adds little value compared to the overhead of more complicated solutions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reflect on how breaking down a problem into smaller components can help you approach it more effectively.</strong>  
                            Breaking problems into smaller sub-problems allows for better manageability, easier debugging, and systematic solution design.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reflect on the trade-offs while choosing between different approaches to solve a problem.</strong>  
                            A balance needs to be struck between the efficiency of the algorithm and its complexity. For example, dynamic programming is more accurate but may have higher space complexity.</li>
                        <li><strong>How do you identify and address potential limitations or weaknesses in a proposed solution?</strong>  
                            Testing edge cases and performance bottlenecks helps identify limitations, allowing me to refine the solution further.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reflect on how applying knowledge from one context can help you solve a problem in a different context.</strong>  
                            Knowledge from graph algorithms can help solve network routing problems, as both deal with optimal pathfinding and connectivity issues.</li>
                        <li><strong>How do you decide when to innovate versus relying on tried-and-tested solutions?</strong>  
                            Innovation is necessary when existing solutions fail to meet new requirements or constraints, but I rely on established solutions when they are efficient and scalable enough.</li>
